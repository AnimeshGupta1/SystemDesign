- Sharding
- Paritioning

- Adding more databases and splitting data amongst them
    - Each database server is a shard
    - And the data is partitioned
    - We partition the data, and decide in which shard which partition will live
    - We can move the partitions amongst the shards

- Paritioning of data can be
    - Horizontally, put some rows in DB1, and rest rows in DB2
    - Vertically, Choosing which tables live in which DB.
