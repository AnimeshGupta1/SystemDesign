- Isolation Levels dictate how much one transaction knows about the other
- Repeatable Read
    - If database is changed elsewhere, it remains the same for us until we commit it.
- Read Commited
    - Reads become inconsistent, if the database is commited somewhere, the commited value is Read
- Read Uncommited
    - Here transaction a reads values changed by transaction b, that are still not commited
    - This causes dirty read as transaction b may even roll back
- Serializable
    - Every read is a locking read
    - Until one transaction commits or rollsback, second transaction can not read
